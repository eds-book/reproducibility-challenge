# Overview

After the registration deadline, the Organising Committee will mediate team formation and assign team members based on paper preferences and skills. Each team will be composed of 2-4 participants depending on the final number of registrants and the paper preferences.

The full application process and corresponding stages for participants and their teams are summarized [here](../details/application.md).

In the next sections, we will provide more detailed information about the logistics before, during and after the CI2023 reproducibility challenge. The different roles within the team members as well as detailed workflow for day to day work will be explicited too.
