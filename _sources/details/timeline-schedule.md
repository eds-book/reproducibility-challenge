All CI2023 Reproducibility Challenge activities will take place virtually on May 1-31. 
The Zoom link is pinned on the #6-reproducibility-challenge channel in the CI2023 slack workspace. 
We will have an overview of technologies, followed by a series of talk with the expert sessions. 
We strongly encourage participants to attend these sessions.
Clinics & Coffee Drop-in OPTIONAL activities will be on Fridays 15:00-16:00. 
See the schedule below for details.

All times listed below are UTC + 1 (British Summer Time). You might want to consult this [Time Zone Map](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/) to figure out times in your location.

We suggest teams allocate an average of about 2 hours per day for preparing their submissions.
