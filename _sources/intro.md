## Reproducibility Challenge

Welcome to the 2023 Climate Informatics Reproducibility Challenge!

## Objectives
This year's challenge aims to build community, facilitate collaboration, and advance open science within the Climate Informatics community, continuing the tradition of an annual Climate Informatics conference-associated hackathon whilst drawing inspiration from [The ML Reproducibility Challenge](https://twitter.com/repro_challenge?lang=en).

## Overview
In this year's challenge, teams of 2-4 will collaborate to create a notebook which reproduces the key contributions of a published environmental data science paper for eventual integration in the open-source [Environmental Data Science (EDS) Book](https://edsbook.org/). Over the course of a month, teams will locate the data and code associated with their chosen paper; train, validate, and test the models used in the paper; visualise key results from these experiments; discuss their work with peer reviewer(s); and ultimately weave together a narrative illuminating the value of open science which culminates in a citeable, DOI-tagged notebook. Teams will further have the opportunity to network and exchange technical Q&A with fellow participants in weekly drop-in socials throughout the competition. Check out [this notebook](https://edsbook.org/notebooks/gallery/ac327c3a-5264-40a2-8c6e-1e8d7c4b37ef/notebook.html) in the EDS book which reproduces [IceNet (Andersson, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25257-4) for an example of what you'll be working towards!

## Cloud infrastructure

To facilitate the reproducibility of papers, a cloud infrastructure with a [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) Machine Learning JupyterHub is being made available (registration to this service is required and free) by the [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://eosc-portal.eu).

**Information about access to the JupyterHub can be found [here](preparation/setup).**

## Summary
Too long; didnâ€™t read? Here is the TL;DR on the 2023 Climate Informatics Reproducibility Challenge:
- Teams of 2-4
- free Pangeo ML jupyterhub available on EOSC C-SCALE cloud infrastructure 
- Reproducing a pre-approved environmental data science or participant-suggested paper as a notebook
- Submissions to be judged after one month
- Winning team to receive Cambridge University Press book of their choosing (up to Â£500 in value split across the winning team) 
- Authorship on a citeable, DOI-tagged notebook to be integrated within the [Environmental Data Science (EDS) Book](https://edsbook.org/)
- Great networking and community-building opportunity
