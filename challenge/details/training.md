# Training
The challenge offers participants two spaces to support their professional development and networking.

## Clinics
The purpose of clinics is to help participants overcome any technical or methodological barriers they may encounter during the reproducibility process. 
 
We will run clinics during the week before team formation and during the challenge to will have hands-on assistance with tools and software, guidance on data management and analysis, and general advice on best practices in reproducibility.

Clinics can be particularly useful for participants who are new to reproducibility or who may not have extensive experience with the tools and techniques involved. 
By providing a supportive and collaborative environment, clinics can help participants gain confidence and develop the skills they need to produce high-quality reproducible research.

Overall, clinics can be a valuable component of a reproducibility challenge, providing an opportunity for participants to receive hands-on guidance and support in their efforts to produce reproducible research.

## Talk with experts
Talking with experts can be a valuable part of a reproducibility challenge, particularly for participants who may be new to the field or who are encountering technical or methodological challenges during the reproducibility process. Here are some ways to facilitate conversations with experts:

Panel discussions: Organize panel discussions with experts in the field to provide insights into reproducibility best practices, data management, and analysis techniques. These discussions can be held virtually, and can be recorded and made available to participants who are unable to attend in real-time.

Office hours: Set up virtual office hours where participants can schedule one-on-one time with experts to receive guidance and assistance with specific technical or methodological issues. These sessions can be scheduled in advance, and can be conducted via videoconference or other virtual platforms.

Discussion forums: Create online discussion forums where participants can ask questions and receive feedback from experts and other participants. These forums can be moderated to ensure that the discussion remains on-topic and productive.

By providing opportunities for participants to engage with experts, a reproducibility challenge can help ensure that participants have the support they need to produce high-quality reproducible research. These conversations can help participants overcome technical and methodological challenges, and can provide valuable insights into reproducibility best practices.
