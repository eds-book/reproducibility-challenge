# How to measure Impact

We will measure the impact of the CI2023 reproducibility challenge:

Reproducibility: The primary goal of a reproducibility challenge is to assess the reproducibility of a scientific study. The success of the challenge can be measured by the number of submissions that are able to reproduce the original study's results.

Participation: The number of participants who register for and submit to the challenge is another measure of success. A larger number of participants can indicate a higher level of interest and engagement in the scientific community.

Quality of submissions: The quality of the submissions can be evaluated based on the established evaluation criteria. A higher quality of submissions can indicate a greater level of rigor and attention to detail in the reproduction process.

Feedback: Feedback from participants, reviewers, and judges can be used to evaluate the success of the challenge. Feedback can be used to identify areas of improvement for future challenges and to gauge the overall satisfaction of participants.

Impact: The impact of the reproducibility challenge can be measured by the degree to which it raises awareness of the importance of reproducibility in scientific research and promotes best practices for reproducibility.

Ultimately, the success of a reproducibility challenge will depend on its specific goals and objectives, as well as the level of engagement and participation from the scientific community.
