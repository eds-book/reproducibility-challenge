## Why notebooks?
In a reproducibility challenge, notebooks can be used as a way to share and evaluate the reproduction process. Notebooks are a type of document that allows users to combine text, code, and visualizations into a single document. Here are some ways that notebooks can be used in a reproducibility challenge:

Sharing code: Notebooks can be used to share the code used to reproduce the original study's results. This can include the code used to generate figures, analyze data, or run simulations.

Providing documentation: Notebooks can include text descriptions of the reproduction process, including any modifications or adaptations made to the original study's methods. This can help reviewers and judges understand the reproduction process and assess the accuracy of the results.

Facilitating evaluation: Notebooks can be used as a platform for reviewers and judges to evaluate the submissions. They can easily run and modify the code, and see the results in real-time.

Encouraging transparency: Notebooks can help promote transparency by allowing reviewers and judges to see exactly how the reproduction was conducted. This can help ensure that the reproduction process was conducted in a rigorous and transparent manner.

Improving reproducibility: Notebooks can be used to highlight areas of the reproduction process where improvements can be made to increase reproducibility. This can include identifying areas where the original study's methods were unclear or where the data or code were not well-documented.

Overall, notebooks can be a powerful tool for sharing and evaluating the reproduction process in a reproducibility challenge. They allow participants to share their code and documentation in a transparent and accessible way, and can help promote best practices for reproducibility.

## Why JupyterHub?
JupyterHub is an open-source software that allows users to run Jupyter notebooks on a shared server. Jupyter notebooks are a type of interactive document that allows users to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document.

JupyterHub can be used in the context of a reproducibility challenge to provide a shared platform for participants to run their code and reproduce the original study's results. By using JupyterHub, participants can access a shared computing environment that is pre-configured with the necessary dependencies and software needed to run the code. This can help reduce the time and effort required to set up the reproduction environment, and ensure that all participants are using the same computing environment.

JupyterHub can also be used to facilitate collaboration between participants, as they can work together in the same computing environment and share their notebooks and code with each other. This can help foster a sense of community and encourage participants to learn from each other and share best practices.

In addition, JupyterHub can be used to provide a platform for reviewers and judges to evaluate the submissions. Reviewers and judges can access the notebooks and code in JupyterHub and run the code to reproduce the original study's results. This can help ensure that the submissions are evaluated in a consistent and transparent manner.

Overall, JupyterHub can be a powerful tool for reproducibility challenges, as it provides a shared computing environment that can help reduce barriers to participation and facilitate collaboration and evaluation.

## Why Zenodo?
Zenodo is a research data repository that allows researchers to share and preserve their research outputs, including data, code, and publications. It is operated by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and is free to use for researchers and institutions.

Zenodo allows researchers to upload their research outputs and assign them a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which provides a persistent identifier that can be used to cite the research. This makes it easier for researchers to share and cite their work, and helps ensure that research outputs are preserved for the long term.

In the context of a reproducibility challenge, Zenodo can be used as a platform for participants to share their reproduction code, data, and documentation. Participants can create a Zenodo record for their submission, which can include a link to a GitHub repository containing their reproduction code and documentation. The Zenodo record can also be used to share any data used in the reproduction process, making it easy for others to reproduce the results.

Using Zenodo can help ensure that the reproduction process is transparent and accessible to others, and can help promote best practices for reproducibility. It also makes it easier for reviewers and judges to evaluate the submissions, as they can easily access the code, data, and documentation in one place.

## Why EDS book?
The Environmental Data Science (EDS) book is a free online textbook that provides an introduction to environmental data science using Python. The book covers a wide range of topics in environmental data science, including data wrangling, data visualization, spatial analysis, machine learning, and more.

The EDS book is designed to be interactive, with many code examples and exercises throughout the text. It is also designed to be modular, with each chapter covering a different topic in environmental data science.

One of the strengths of the EDS book is that it is designed to be accessible to a wide range of readers, from beginners to advanced users. It provides a solid foundation in the concepts and techniques of environmental data science, while also providing opportunities for readers to explore more advanced topics.

Overall, the EDS book can be a useful resource for anyone interested in learning environmental data science using Python, whether for a reproducibility challenge or for other applications.
