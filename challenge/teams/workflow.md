# Workflow for a Notebook Project

Teams must follow [EDS book submission guidelines](https://edsbook.org/publishing/guidelines.html#guidelines-for-eds-book-notebooks). They should open a [Notebook Idea](https://edsbook.org/publishing/guidelines/guidelines-authors.html#notebook-idea) in the EDS book repository to describe and discuss initial ideas of the paper to reproduce. EDS book provides [templates of notebook repositories in Python, R and Julia](https://edsbook.org/publishing/guidelines/guidelines-authors.html#notebook-repository) that aim to facilitate teams submission. Teams should reproduce the studyâ€™s results as closely as possible using the available data and code. They should document their process and any deviations from the original study in a Jupyter notebook.

The following workflow can be used during the reproducibility challenge:

1. Each team member (or as a group) should carefully read the paper and identify the data used/needed, software used and overall what you would have to reproduce during the challenge;
2. Choose the notebook template depending on the programming language (Python, R and/or Julia) and click on "use this template" button to create a new repository. This step should be done by the technical lead of your team only e.g. only one repository needs to be created.
3. The team lead (owner of the repository) adds all the other team members as collaborators to the repository.
4. Create issues to organize and dispatch the work. You may use Github project but make sure all the team members are acquainted with the procedures put in place in your team; 
5. Start working (incrementally!) on reproducing the paper. Testing independent sections is recommended. don't forget to take regular breaks and HAVE FUN! Whenever you have achieved a milestone (can be data downloaded, a plot, etc.), make sure to communicate with your peers so that the team presenter can gather the necessary information to show your progress/pending issues during checkpoints.


At all stages, do not hesitate to ask for help in the Climate Informatics 2023 slack channel!
