CI2023 Reproducibility Challenge shares University of Washington eScience Hackweeks and NASA Openscapes Champions Program goals of supporting researchers with inclusive open science practices for data-intensive science. 
The challenge was designed with complementary structure to support these goals.
Openscapes Champions Program supports teams in discussion-based planning and mindsets and meets virtually for 1.5 hours every other week for 2 months. 
eScience Hackweeks support hands-on skillbuilding and projects and meet daily for 5-10 days. 

Other programs running similar training in data-intensive settings under Open Science principles:
