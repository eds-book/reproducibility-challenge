# Learning to code
There is a wide diversity of programming languages and open source software suited to Climate and Environmental research. 

We present below a list of resources suggested to help strengthen your coding skills for the Reproducibility Challenge and some Scientific ecosystems supporting Climate and Environmental research.

## Foundations

### Python
* [Duke STA-663 - Colin Rundel](https://sta663-sp22.github.io/). Lecture slides & recordings, code & notebooks. Features Jupyter, git, numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn...
* [Intro to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python - Carpentries](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/). Follow-along tutorials & code. Features NEON data, intro to rasters & geostats rioxarray, geopandas...
* [Intro to Earth and Environmental Data Science- Ryan Abernathy](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html). Intro to Python, JupyterLab, Unix, Git, some packages & workflows
* [Scalable and Computationally Reproducible Approaches to Arctic Research - NCEAS](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-03-arctic/). Advanced topics in computationally reproducible research in python, including environments, docker containers, and parallel processing using tools like parsl and dask, responsible research and data management practices including data sovereignty and the CARE principles, and ethical concerns with data-intensive modeling and analysis.33
* [Project Pythia Foundations Book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html)

### R
* [Intro to Open Data Science with R - Lowndes & Horst](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/). Follow-along tutorials & code. Features workflows with RMarkdown, tidyverse, RStudio, GitHub...
* [What they forgot to teach you about R - Bryan & Hester](https://rstats.wtf/). Reinforcing lessons for moderately experienced R users
* [R for Data Science - Wickham & Grolemund.](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - All things tidyverse, including dates, plots, modeling, programming, RMarkdown
* Online learning community/book club: [rfordatasci.com](https://www.rfordatasci.com/)
- [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/): for novice programmers to write modular code and covers best practices for using R for data analysis

### Julia
