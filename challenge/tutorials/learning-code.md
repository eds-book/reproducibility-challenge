# Learning to code

There is a wide diversity of programming languages and open source software suited to Climate and Environmental research. 

We present below a list of resources suggested to help strengthen your coding skills for the Reproducibility Challenge and some Scientific ecosystems supporting Climate and Environmental research.

### Cross-languages (Python, R and/or Julia)

* [CU EarthLab's Earth Data Science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/). Provide resources to access and work with data using R and Python and to setup R and Python environments

## Open Scientific Ecosystems

We list below some communities developing and maintaining Open source scientific software. 

### Python

- [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/). Scalable tools designed to work together for big geosciences data access, processing and analysis.
