# GitHub and ORCID

For the CI2023 reproducibility challenge, you will need both [Github](https://github.com) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org) accounts. 

If you already have a Github and/or ORCID account, you can skip the corresponding section.

## Github account

You will need a GitHub account to create a GitHub repository where you will share, with other team members, the reviewers and organizers, the notebook and other related information about the paper you reproduce. If you already have a GitHub account, skip this section.

- Go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).
- Type a user name, your email address, and a password. (user names are unique within Github so you may not be able to choose your preferred user names. You can add a digit at the end or in the middle, or mix your first name and last name).
- Choose Sign up for GitHub, and then follow the instructions.

**Please share your Github user name with the organizers (in this [Github issue](TBD)).**

If you are not familiar with version control and Git, the tutorial "[Version control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice) from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a very good starting point. We recommend you to visit the tutorial sections of this CI2023 reproducibility challenge website. 

## ORCID account

[![ORCID iD](../figures/ORCIDiD_icon16x16.png) ORCID](https://orcid.org) is an international, interdisciplinary, open, non-proprietary, and not-for-profit organization that provides ORCID iDs to anyone who participates in research, scholarship, or innovation.

[Registration to get an ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/register) is free of charge and it provides you with a unique, open digital identifier: you can use the same iD throughout your whole career, even if your name changes or you move to a different institution, discipline, or country. 

If you already have an ORCID iD account, skip this section.

- Go to [https://orcid.org/register](https://orcid.org/register)
- Type your name and email address. You can use your institutional email address as primary email but we recommend to add an additional email address that is independent from your institution.

You can also watch [tutorial videos](https://info.orcid.org/video-tutorials/) to get more information.
