   * MG: How many Pangeo users?
       * ClimateInformatics, very recent
       * CLIVAR (bootcamp), 50 users
       * E-Science, (master/PhD, academic), 20 students + 10
       * FOSS4G, 25-30 users
   * VD: Do you have a marketplace regarding the different jupyter notebook ?
       * Pangeo isn't yet available in the IM manager
   * ACC: Health report
       * Where we are vs. what EGI promised.
       * Heatwave in Italy caused issues
   * VD: "I am interested in the training part for deploying EGI-ACE type infrastructure, do you have some information about this training?"
       * On the github repository you can find the details of how the infrastructures for FOSS4G/CLIVAR/eScience were deployed (including the Helm charts) and there is a link to a video providing more details about the Infrastructure Manager (IM) dashboard
   * ACC: "How to measure the energy footprint of these infrastructures"
       * EGI is collecting data about energy use and have prerequisites when buying new servers about the energy efficiency (SLV is to share more details later)
   * AF: "What shoudl new communities do to joinand work with EGI?"
       * Until now call for use cases, also "contact us" on the website (email, form) to ask for a meeting and discuss the request
       * Contact EGI at [https://www.egi.eu/egi-foundation/how-to-reach-us/](https://www.egi.eu/egi-foundation/how-to-reach-us/) (at the bottom there is a form where you can request
