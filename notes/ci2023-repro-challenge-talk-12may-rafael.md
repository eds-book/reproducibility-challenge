## ⁉ Open Q \& A  

*The zoom room will remain open from 09:30-10:00 UTC+1 for an open Q\&A. This part of the call will not be recorded, and is optional for both speakers and the audience.*

   *  You said rasterise is faster then gdal: is it written in Julia?
       * Easier to get several packages working together
       * Recompile on the fly
   * How difficult would you say is learning Julia if you are already experienced with Python? How similar are the two languages?
   * Collaboration between JuliaGeo and Makie Organisations

## 📝 Notes, comments and references by attendees

   * Julia is a young programming language, still many packages (found in R or Python ecosystem) may not be available but in terms of speed and overlal performance Julia is outperforming Python and R. So if performance is needed for your work then choose Julia. 
   * JuliaGeo is where you can go to find all the packages \& informaiton about geospatial in Julia: many examples, discourse page for discussions.
   * GeoInterface.jl: glue for the spatial data ecosystem, allows packages to interct without direct dependencies.
   * Rasters.jl: wrapper for ArchGDAL, NCDatasets.jl, etc. 
   * MakieOrg: Makie.jl
   * Tyler.jl: interactive tile plotting for Julia.
   * GeoMakie.jl: very useful for projected plotting.
   * GeometryOps: new package to reproject 
   * MakieDraw: rapid live edit
   * Datashader: recently added in Makie
   * use manifest to have reproducibility (list of packages with exact version)
